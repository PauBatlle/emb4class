We provide four different classification datasets to try the package. In all the datasets, we separate between the sentences and their category/label. The labels are encoded as numbers from 0 to number_of_classes-1, where 0 is the first label in the label_titles file and number_of_classes-1 is the last label in the same file.

The included datasets are only the parts of the original datasets which are relevant for
